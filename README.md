# Quantum-Safe Trust-Aware STIN Framework (QS-STIN)

This repository presents a **Python-based demonstrator** for a **Quantum-Safe, Trust-Aware Security Framework** designed for **Satellite–Terrestrial Integrated Networks (STINs)**, a key enabler of future **6G connectivity**.

## 🔐 Overview
The framework simulates secure data exchange between satellite and ground entities using:
- **Quantum-resistant cryptographic hashing (SHA3-256)**
- **Blockchain-inspired immutable ledgers**
- **Dynamic trust scoring updated only on confirmed attacks**
- **Fair-exchange verification and tamper detection**

The design is inspired by **O-RAN modular security principles**, extended toward **space–aerial–terrestrial convergence**.

## 🛰️ Key Features
- Quantum-safe hashing for metadata integrity  
- Trust-aware block validation under adversarial conditions  
- Attack simulation with controlled attack rates  
- Distributed ledger growth and traceability  
- Trust evolution, variance, and scalability analysis  
- Python-based, lightweight, and reproducible

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics
- Trust score evolution over time  
- Attack detection consistency  
- Transaction latency  
- Ledger scalability  
- Storage overhead  
- Trust stability under attacks  

## 🧪 Experimental Setup
Publicly accessible mission metadata is used to emulate realistic satellite data flows. Controlled attacks simulate fake receivers and block tampering to evaluate system resilience and trust degradation.

## 🚀 Significance
Results demonstrate that combining **O-RAN-inspired programmability** with **quantum-safe trust mechanisms** provides a scalable, future-proof foundation for secure, interoperable, and intelligent **STIN deployments in 6G networks**.

## 📌 Use Case
- Secure satellite–ground data exchange  
- Inter-operator trust management  
- Federated learning coordination  
- Mission tasking and resource negotiation
